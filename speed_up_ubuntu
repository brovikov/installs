# Well, let's try speed up my ubuntu laptop:

# let's tune swappiness.

> sudo apt-get install gksu leafpad

# check your current swappiness value. Type in the terminal (use copy/paste):
> cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

# To change the swappiness into a more sensible setting, type in the terminal (use copy/paste to avoid typo's):
> gksudo leafpad /etc/sysctl.conf

Scroll to the bottom of the text file and add your swappiness parameter to override the default. Copy/paste the following lines:
# Decrease swap usage to a more reasonable level
vm.swappiness=10
